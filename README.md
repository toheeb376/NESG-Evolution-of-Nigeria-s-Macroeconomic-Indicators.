## ⚠️ Key Observations
1. **Economic Growth**: GDP growth remained modest (3.1%–3.5% in 2024), indicating resilience but insufficient to offset population growth.
2. **Inflation Surge**: Inflation accelerated to **34.4%**, eroding purchasing power and worsening living conditions.
3. **Exchange Rate Depreciation**: Naira depreciated from **₦380/$ in 2021** to **₦1622/$ in Q4 2024**, driven by forex scarcity and investor uncertainty.
4. **Debt Sustainability**: Public debt more than tripled between 2021 and 2024, raising sustainability concerns.
5. **Capital Flight**: Foreign inflows weakened drastically (under $0.5bn in 2024 Q1–Q3), reflecting **low investor confidence**.
6. **High Borrowing Costs**: Interest rates above 30% in 2024 discouraged private sector borrowing and stifled investment.
